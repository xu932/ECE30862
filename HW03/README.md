# Homework 02

## Part 1
Look at the code in directory `HW3a` and modify `Base.h`, `Base.cpp`, `Derived.h` and `Derived.cpp` so that the function calls in main.cpp give the output indicated in the comment beside each function call.

## Part 2
Look at the code in `HW3b`. Grep for “PUT”, and in those files add code to give the output below when running the program. The code to be added will be similar to code in the other classes, and the comments in the files containing “PUT” give hints as to which files to look at.

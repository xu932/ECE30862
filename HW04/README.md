# HW04

This homework focuses on polymorphism and virtual and non-virtual functions. In the file main.cpp, for each line with a comment like “// Q40” say what is printed by the line. If the line gives an error, just write “E”. If the line prints nothing, but does not give an error, just say “Ok”.


Note: with a little luck you can make this compile and execute, and get the answers very easily. However, you will not be able to compile and execute the test, and you won’t learn a lot by doing that. So I don’t recommend taking this approach. After completing the homework, you can compile and run this to test your answers. I’ll also post a key after the homework is due and go over it in class.
